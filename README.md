# Clustering-Analysis

# Overview
This repository contains code and documentation for a clustering analysis project aimed at determining the optimal number of clusters and clustering algorithms for eight sets of data. Clustering is a fundamental unsupervised learning technique used to identify inherent groupings or patterns within datasets. The project utilizes various clustering algorithms, including DBSCAN, k-means, hierarchical clustering, and others, to analyze the data and determine the most suitable clustering approach for each dataset.

# Project Goals
Identify optimal clustering algorithms for different types of datasets.
Determine the optimal number of clusters for each dataset.
Compare the performance of different clustering algorithms.
Provide insights into the underlying structure of the data.
Generate visualizations to aid in the interpretation of clustering results.

# Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the datasets to ensure compatibility with clustering algorithms. This may involve handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.

Clustering Analysis: Apply multiple clustering algorithms, including DBSCAN, k-means, hierarchical clustering, and density-based clustering, to each dataset. Explore a range of parameter values to determine the optimal configuration for each algorithm.

Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate the quality of clustering results using appropriate metrics such as silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, and visual inspection of clustering plots. Additionally, dendrograms are used for hierarchical clustering analysis.

Optimal Clustering Selection: Select the optimal number of clusters and clustering algorithm for each dataset based on the evaluation metrics, including silhouette scores and dendrogram analysis, as well as domain knowledge.

Visualization: Visualize clustering results using scatter plots, dendrograms, heatmaps, and other techniques to gain insights into the underlying data structure.
